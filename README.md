## Troubleshooting private instances

If your instance runs, but you’re having issues configuring agents, navigate to `http://{your_instance’s_ip}/install` to [check for a valid configuration](https://docs.webpagetest.org/private-instances/#web-server-install).

## Testing

WebPageTest uses [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de) for unit tests. To set up and run the unit tests:

1. Install [Composer](https://getcomposer.org)
2. Run `composer install`
3. Run `composer test`

## Contributing

There are separate lines of development under different licenses (pull requests accepted to either):

- The `master` branch where most active development occurs has the [Polyform Shield 1.0.0 license](LICENSE.md)
- The `apache` branch has the more permissive [Apache 2.0 license](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)

### Code style

WebPageTest uses PSR12 coding conventions for PHP and Prettier defaults for JavaScript and CSS.
Before you send a pull request please make sure to run: `composer format`.

Alternatively you can run
`composer format:php` if you only touched PHP code
`composer format:prettier` if you only touched CSS or JavaScript code

### VSCode integration

If you use VSCode you might find it helpful to install Prettier and PHP Intelephence plugins and use these in your "settings.json":

```
{
  "[php]": {
    "editor.tabSize": 4
  },

  // uncomment to reformat on every file save
  //"editor.formatOnSave": true,

  "phpcs.standard": "PSR12",

  "files.trimTrailingWhitespace": true,

  "files.eol": "\n",

  "files.associations": {
    "*.inc": "php"
  }
}
```
